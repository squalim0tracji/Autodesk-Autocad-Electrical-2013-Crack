## Features of Autodesk AutoCAD Electrical 2013
     
Autodesk AutoCAD Electrical 2013 offers a range of features that boost productivity and efficiency for electrical design projects. Some of the main features are:
     
- **Access to a library of 65,000+ intelligent electrical symbols**: You can easily insert and edit symbols from various standards, such as IEEE, ANSI, JIC, NFPA, GB, IEC, and more. The symbols are automatically connected with wires and updated with component tags.
- **Automation of numbering of wires and generation of component tags**: You can assign unique wire numbers and component tags to your electrical schematic drawings. The software automatically updates the wire numbers and component tags when you make changes to the circuit.
- **Creation of panel layouts and bills of materials (BOMs)**: You can generate panel layouts based on your schematic drawings. The software automatically populates the panel layout with symbols, footprints, and annotations. You can also create BOMs that list the components and quantities used in your project.
- **Integration with other Autodesk products**: You can exchange data and collaborate with other Autodesk products, such as Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk Revit, Autodesk Vault, and more. You can also import and export data from other formats, such as DWG, DXF, PDF, XML, CSV, etc.
- **Support for Windows 8 and 64-bit systems**: Autodesk AutoCAD Electrical 2013 is compatible with Windows 8 Standard, Enterprise, or Professional edition (requires installation of AutoCAD Electrical 2013 Service Pack 2). It also supports 64-bit systems for better performance and stability.

## Benefits of Autodesk AutoCAD Electrical 2013
     
Autodesk AutoCAD Electrical 2013 provides several benefits for electrical design professionals. Some of the main benefits are:

- **Improved productivity and accuracy**: You can save time and reduce errors by using the intelligent symbols, automated wire numbering and component tagging, panel layout generation, and BOM creation features. The software also checks for errors and inconsistencies in your drawings and reports them to you.
- **Enhanced collaboration and coordination**: You can share and synchronize data with other Autodesk products and formats. You can also use the cloud-based services to store, access, and manage your projects online. You can also work with other team members on the same project using the multi-user editing feature.
- **Optimized design quality and performance**: You can create high-quality electrical schematic drawings that comply with various standards and regulations. You can also use the 3D modeling features to visualize your designs in realistic scenarios. You can also test your designs for functionality and reliability using the simulation tools.
